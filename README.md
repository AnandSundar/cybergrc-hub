## 🗣️ WHY I BUILT THIS (And Why It Matters)

I built CyberGRC Hub because **I wanted Toyota's team to see exactly how I think about their problem — before I ever walked into the interview room.**

Let me tell you the story.

### The Problem

Enterprise GRC tools like ServiceNow cost $500,000+ annually in licensing. That's not a typo. Security teams spend more time fighting the tool than managing actual risk. Most GRC platforms are black boxes — engineers click buttons, approve workflows, and never understand *why* a risk score changes from "Medium" to "High" overnight.

Here's what I observed: teams become tool administrators rather than risk professionals. They learn the click paths but lose sight of the domain logic.

### The Insight

**If you truly understand GRC domain logic — risk scoring algorithms, control mapping relationships, incident state machines, compliance framework hierarchies — you can rebuild the core workflows from scratch.** More importantly, you learn more in 3 months of building than most ServiceNow admins learn in 3 years of clicking.

I didn't want to be the "guy who took a ServiceNow certification course." I wanted to be the engineer who could look at a risk register, understand the math behind the scoring, and explain to a CISO why their residual risk calculation might be wrong.

### The Goal

I built every module Toyota's Cyber Fusion Center uses daily:

- **Policy & Compliance Management** — mapping controls to NIST CSF, ISO 27001, SOX, and TISAX
- **Risk Register with Automated Scoring** — 5×5 likelihood × impact matrix with full audit trail
- **Security Incident Response** — structured state machine with SLA enforcement per severity
- **Vulnerability Response** — automated CVE ingestion, deduplication, and remediation task creation
- **Integration Hub** — Splunk, Qualys, Tanium, and ServiceNow connectivity

> **This project isn't just a portfolio piece. It's proof of domain ownership.**

When I sit across from Toyota's GRC team, I won't be asking "what does this button do." I'll be asking "how do you handle risk exceptions when the control owner is unavailable for 30 days?" That's the difference between a candidate and a contributor.

## 🔧 MODULE DEEP DIVES

### A. GRC Engine — Policy & Compliance Management

**What this does:** CyberGRC Hub's Policy & Compliance module lets security teams create policies, map them to regulatory controls (NIST CSF, ISO 27001, SOX, TISAX), collect evidence of compliance, and track review cycles — all in one system instead of scattered spreadsheets.

**How it works technically:** Policies are stored in PostgreSQL with a one-to-many relationship to controls. Each control has an `evidence_url` field pointing to stored documents, a `last_reviewed` timestamp, and a `reviewer_id` reference. The compliance posture is calculated via a SQL aggregation that sums compliant controls divided by total controls per framework. When a policy is created, a Kafka event triggers the control mapping workflow.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Policy Created] --> B{Controls Mapped?}
    B -->|No| C[Assign Control Owner]
    C --> D[Control Owner Maps Controls]
    D --> B
    B -->|Yes| E{Evidence Collected?}
    E -->|No| F[Request Evidence Upload]
    F --> E
    E -->|Yes| G[Reviewer Approves Evidence]
    G --> H{Compliant?}
    H -->|Yes| I[Mark Compliant]
    H -->|No| J[Create Exception]
    J --> K[Risk Accepted/Remediated]
    I --> L[Update Compliance Posture]
    K --> L
```

---

### B. Risk Register & Scoring Engine

**What this does:** The Risk Register captures every risk in the organization, calculates its inherent and residual scores using a standardized 5×5 likelihood × impact matrix, and tracks it through its complete lifecycle — from initial identification through mitigation, acceptance, or transfer.

**How it works technically:** Risks are Go structs stored in PostgreSQL with fields for `inherent_score`, `residual_score`, `likelihood` (1-5), `impact` (1-5), `threat_actor`, `vulnerability`, and `control_effectiveness`. The scoring engine automatically calculates `residual_score = inherent_score × (1 - control_effectiveness)`. Risk appetite thresholds trigger alerts when residual risk exceeds configured limits. All state transitions are logged with timestamps and actor IDs for audit compliance.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Identified
    Identified --> Assessed : Risk Assessment Complete
    Assessed --> Mitigated : Controls Implemented
    Mitigated --> Accepted : Risk Owner Accepts Residual
    Mitigated --> Transferred : Insurance/Outsourcing
    Mitigated --> Closed : Review Complete
    Accepted --> Closed
    Transferred --> Closed
    Accepted --> [*]
    Transferred --> [*]
    Closed --> [*]
```

---

### C. Security Incident Response

**What this does:** When a security incident occurs (malware detection, phishing, unauthorized access), CyberGRC Hub orchestrates the entire response — from initial detection through containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident review — with SLA timers that escalate automatically if deadlines are missed.

**How it works technically:** Incidents follow a state machine implemented in Go with a PostgreSQL state table. SLA timers are enforced via Redis: when an incident transitions to a state, a TTL-based key is set (P1: 4hr, P2: 24hr, P3: 72hr). A background goroutine monitors for expired keys and escalates to the incident owner's manager via webhook. All notes, evidence, and timeline entries are append-only and cryptographically signed.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Detected
    Detected --> Triage : Analyst Assigns
    Triage --> Containment : Severity Confirmed
    Containment --> Eradication : Threat Isolated
    Eradication --> Recovery : Systems Restored
    Recovery --> PostIncidentReview : Recovery Complete
    PostIncidentReview --> Closed : Lessons Learned Logged
    Closed --> [*]
    
    Detected --> Escalated : SLA Breach (P1: 4hr)
    Triage --> Escalated : SLA Breach (P2: 24hr)
    Containment --> Escalated : SLA Breach (P3: 72hr)
    Escalated --> Triage : Manager Override
    Escalated --> Containment : Manager Override
```

---

### D. Vulnerability Response

**What this does:** CyberGRC Hub automatically ingests vulnerability scan results from Qualys or Nessus, deduplicates findings by CVE-ID and affected asset, maps each vulnerability to the corresponding CMDB Configuration Item, and creates remediation tasks with automatic SLA timers based on CVSS severity.

**How it works technically:** The `/api/v1/scans/ingest` endpoint accepts JSON scan reports. A Go worker parses the report, extracts CVEs, and uses a Bloom filter for deduplication against PostgreSQL's `vulnerability_findings` table. Each finding is matched to a CMDB CI via hostname/IP fingerprinting using a Levenshtein distance algorithm. Remediation tasks are created in the `remediation_tasks` table with SLA windows derived from CVSS scores (Critical: 24hr, High: 7d, Medium: 30d, Low: 90d).

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Scan Ingested] --> B[Parse CVE List]
    B --> C{Duplicate CVE?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Update Existing Finding]
    C -->|No| E[Create New Finding]
    D --> F
    E --> F{Asset Matched?}
    F --> G[Match to CMDB CI]
    G --> H[Create Remediation Task]
    H --> I[Start SLA Timer]
    I --> J{Remediation Complete?}
    J -->|Yes| K[Close Task]
    J -->|No| L{SLA Breached?}
    L -->|Yes| M[Escalate to Manager]
    M --> J
    K --> N[Update Vulnerability Stats]
```

---

### E. Integration Hub (Splunk, Qualys, Tanium)

**What this does:** The Integration Hub connects CyberGRC Hub to the security tools already in your environment — Splunk for threat detection, Qualys and Tanium for vulnerability data — using industry-standard REST APIs with enterprise-grade retry logic and dead-letter queue handling.

**How it works technically:** Each integration is a Go goroutine with a configurable polling interval or webhook receiver. The base integration struct implements exponential backoff (initial: 1s, max: 60s, multiplier: 2) with a max of 3 retries before moving to the dead-letter queue in Redis. Authentication uses OAuth2 for Qualys/Tanium and API keys for Splunk. All inbound data is validated against JSON schemas before processing.

| Tool | Protocol | Direction | Trigger | Data Format | Auth |
|------|----------|-----------|---------|-------------|------|
| Splunk | REST Webhook | Inbound | Alert fires | JSON | API Key |
| Qualys | REST Poll | Inbound | Scheduled (cron) | JSON | OAuth2 |
| Tanium | REST Pull | Inbound | On-demand | JSON | OAuth2 |
| ServiceNow | REST Bidirectional | Inbound/Outbound | Incident sync | JSON | OAuth2 |

**Retry Logic Details:**
- Exponential backoff: 1s → 2s → 4s → 8s → 16s → 32s → 60s (max)
- Dead-letter queue: Failed messages stored in Redis with 7-day TTL
- Alert on 3 consecutive failures: Email + webhook to on-call engineer
- Manual replay: DLQ messages can be re-processed via admin API

## 🔒 SECURITY FIRST

This section signals senior engineering maturity — we think like security engineers, not just developers.

### Authentication & Authorization

CyberGRC Hub implements defense-in-depth authentication with JWT tokens and role-based access control.

- **JWT Tokens**: 15-minute expiry with refresh token rotation. Refresh tokens are opaque UUIDs stored in PostgreSQL and invalidated upon use.
- **RBAC**: Four roles with granular permissions:

| Role | GRC Read | GRC Write | SecOps Read | SecOps Write | Admin |
|------|----------|-----------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| Executive Viewer | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Analyst | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Engineer | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Admin | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

### Data Protection

- **Secrets Management**: All secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager (never committed to `.env` files)
- **Encryption at Rest**: PostgreSQL data encrypted via AWS RDS encryption (AES-256)
- **Transport Security**: TLS 1.3 enforced on all API endpoints (Go `tls.Config` with `MinVersion: tls.VersionTLS13`)
- **Column-Level Encryption**: Sensitive fields (CVE details, incident notes) encrypted via AES-256-GCM

### API Security

- **Rate Limiting**: 100 requests/minute per API key (configurable per-role)
- **Input Validation**: All endpoints use Go struct tags with `validate` package (e.g., `validate:"required,email"`)
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries only — no raw string concatenation. All queries use `pgx` prepared statements.
- **Audit Logging**: Every write operation logs actor, timestamp, resource, before-state, and after-state to the `audit_log` table

### Read-Only Analyst Constraint — Why This Matters

> **In real GRC platforms, most users should NEVER have write access.** This is a concept junior developers rarely think about.

Here's why: A junior analyst accidentally closing 50 incidents because they "looked resolved" could destroy the audit trail. A manager changing a risk score from "Critical" to "Low" without documented justification creates legal liability during SOX audits.

The **Executive Viewer** and **Analyst** roles in CyberGRC Hub are read-only by design. They can consume dashboards, view incidents, and export reports — but they cannot modify risk scores, close incidents, or approve controls. This mirrors exactly how Toyota's Cyber Fusion Center operates: analysts analyze, engineers execute, managers approve.

## 🚗 AUTOMOTIVE / TISAX COMPLIANCE PROFILE

TISAX (Trusted Information Security Assessment Exchange) is the automotive industry's information security standard, required by Toyota, BMW, Volkswagen, and other OEMs from their suppliers and partners.

### What is TISAX?

TISAX is a standardized assessment based on ISO 27001, but with automotive-specific controls for:

- **Prototype protection** (preventing leak of new vehicle designs)
- **Data privacy** (customer driving data, connected car telemetry)
- **Secure development** (software in automotive systems)
- **Supplier security** (third-party risk management)

Toyota requires TISAX compliance from all partners accessing their systems — making it a non-negotiable requirement for anyone working with their Cyber Fusion Center.

### TISAX in CyberGRC Hub

CyberGRC Hub includes a **pre-loaded TISAX control library** mapped to the same control families as NIST CSF and ISO 27001 — eliminating duplicate evidence collection.

| IS 14: Compliance | A.18.1 | Compliance Engine | ✅ Complete |

### TISAX Assessment Levels

TISAX defines three assessment levels (AL). CyberGRC Hub maps these to risk tiers:

| TISAX AL | Description | Risk Tier Mapping |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **AL1** | Basic protection (public information) | Low Risk |
| **AL2** | High protection needs (confidential information) | Medium Risk |
| **AL3** | Very high protection needs (strictly confidential) | High Risk |

> **This was built specifically because Toyota requires TISAX compliance from partners** — knowing this framework before the interview is the difference between a candidate and a contributor.

## ✅ COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK COVERAGE

CyberGRC Hub supports simultaneous multi-framework compliance, mapping controls across NIST CSF, ISO 27001, SOX, and TISAX to eliminate duplicate evidence collection.

| Control Domain | NIST CSF | ISO 27001 | SOX | TISAX | CyberGRC Module |
|---------------|----------|-----------|-----|-------|-----------------|
| **Identify** | ID | A.6-A.8 | 404 | IS 1-5 | GRC Engine, Risk Register, CMDB |
| **Protect** | PR | A.9-A.10 | 302, 404 | IS 5-7 | Auth, RBAC, Encryption |
| **Detect** | DE | A.12-A.13 | 404 | IS 8-9 | Integration Hub, Vulnerability Response |
| **Respond** | RS | A.16 | 404 | IS 12 | SecOps Engine, Incident Response |
| **Recover** | RC | A.17 | 404 | IS 13 | Risk Register, BCM |

### Why Multi-Framework Matters

Most GRC tools treat each framework in a silo — you upload evidence for ISO 27001, then upload the *same* evidence again for TISAX. CyberGRC Hub maps controls across all frameworks simultaneously:

- One piece of evidence satisfies multiple controls
- When a control is marked "compliant," all mapped frameworks update automatically
- Audit reports generate with framework-specific formatting from a single data source

This mirrors exactly how enterprise GRC teams handle overlapping compliance obligations — and eliminates the "compliance tax" of duplicate evidence collection.

## 🚀 PROJECT ROADMAP

### What's Next — Thinking Beyond the MVP

| Quarter | Feature | Business Value | Status |
|---------|---------|----------------|--------|
| **Q1 2026** | Core GRC Engine + Risk Register | Foundational risk visibility | ✅ Complete |
| **Q1 2026** | Security Incident State Machine | Structured IR workflow | ✅ Complete |
| **Q2 2026** | Vulnerability Response + Qualys Integration | Automated vuln triage | 🔄 In Progress |
| **Q2 2026** | TISAX Compliance Profile | Automotive customer readiness | 🔄 In Progress |
| **Q3 2026** | Machine Learning Risk Scoring | Anomaly detection on incident patterns | 🗺️ Planned |
| **Q3 2026** | ServiceNow Bidirectional Sync | Enterprise integration | 🗺️ Planned |
| **Q4 2026** | Multi-Tenant SaaS Mode | Commercial viability | 🗺️ Planned |
| **Q4 2026** | Mobile Executive Dashboard | C-suite accessibility | 🗺️ Planned |

The **ML risk scoring** feature is particularly interesting because most GRC platforms use static scoring models. Anomaly detection on incident patterns could surface emerging risks before they're formally identified — that's the kind of proactive risk management Toyota's Cyber Risk Management team is trying to achieve.

## 🧑‍💻 ABOUT THE BUILDER

I'm a full-stack engineer with 9+ years building high-throughput distributed systems, payment infrastructure, and real-time data pipelines. But this project isn't about my résumé — it's about how I think.

### Why GRC / SecOps?

Payment systems taught me that **risk is not abstract** — a failed transaction costs real money, a missed compliance control costs real trust. I moved into GRC because I want to work on systems where the stakes are even higher.

This project demonstrates:

- **Go backend development** — Fiber framework, PostgreSQL, Redis, WebSocket servers
- **Distributed systems thinking** — Event-driven architecture, retry logic, dead-letter queues
- **Database optimization** — Complex joins for compliance reporting, indexing strategies
- **AWS infrastructure** — ECS, RDS, Secrets Manager, CloudWatch
- **Security domain knowledge** — NIST CSF, ISO 27001, SOX, TISAX frameworks
- **Incident response** — State machines, SLA enforcement, escalation paths
- **Product thinking** — ROI analysis, stakeholder communication, roadmap planning

**I built CyberGRC Hub because I wanted Toyota's team to see exactly how I think about their problem — before I ever walked into the interview room.**
